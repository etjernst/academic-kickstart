abstract: "We study the impacts of a rural development program designed to boost   the income of the small-farm sector in Nicaragua. Exploiting the random   assignment of treatment, we find statistically and economically   significant impacts on gross farm income and investment in productive   farm capital. Using continuous treatment estimation techniques, we   examine the evolution of program impacts over time and find that the   estimated income increase persists and that the impacts on productive   capital stock continue to rise even after the program concluded.   Additionally, panel quantile methods reveal striking heterogeneity of   program impacts on both income and investment. We show that this   heterogeneity is not random and that there appear to exist low-  performing household types who benefit little from the program, whereas   high-performing (upper quantile) households benefit more substantially.   Analysis using generalized random forests, a machine learning algorithm,   points toward greater program impacts for households who were   disadvantaged at baseline. Even after controlling for this source of   heterogeneity, we find large and persistent differences in how much   different types of households benefited from the program. While the   benefit-cost ratio of the program is on average positive, the impact   heterogeneity suggests that business development programs aiming to   engage farm households as agricultural entrepreneurs have limitations as   instruments to eliminate rural poverty."
