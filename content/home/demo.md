<br>
I am a Lecturer (Assistant professor) at the University of Sydney's School of Economics.
<br> <br>
My research draws on insights from behavioral economics and employs
econometrics, field-, and lab-in-the-field experiments to examine a variety of
topics in development economics. <br> <br>
I also think a lot about heterogeneity: how it
shapes the success and optimal design of public policy, and how heterogeneous
returns affect individual decision-making.


<!-- I received my B.A. in economics from Colby College (in 2006) and my M.S. and Ph.D. from the Department of Agricultural and Resource Economics at the University of California, Davis (in 2015)
