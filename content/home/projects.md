* [Learning by (Virtually) Doing: Experimentation and Belief Updating in Smallholder Agriculture](files/TLHC2020.pdf)

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In much of sub-Saharan Africa, soil quality heterogeneity hampers farmer   learning about the returns to different inputs. This can partly explain   why we observe
  limited adoption of improved inputs in the region. We study how Kenyan   farmers respond to an interactive app that enables them to discover   agricultural input returns on a virtual plot that is calibrated to   resemble their own. Farmers update both their beliefs and behaviors after   engaging with the virtual learning app. Additionally, farmers revise their   beliefs
  upwards after using the app. In an incentive-compatible experiment,   farmers receive an input budget from the research team, which they can   allocate across farm inputs. After they play several virtual seasons on   the app, they have the opportunity to update these allocations. Farmers   revise their input allocations along several dimensions after the virtual   learning experience. As evidence that these adjustments emerge from real   learning, we show that farmers with the highest predicted returns to lime--  -an unfamiliar input in this region---increase their lime orders more than   others. Our results suggest that engagement with a personalized virtual   platform can induce real learning and enhance  farmers' beliefs and   technology choices.

* [Can Smallholder Extension Transform African Agriculture?](https://www.nber.org/papers/w26054)
_with Joshua Deutschmann, Maya Duru and Kim Siegal_ <br>
NBER Working Paper No. 26054
<br>
Submitted :crossed_fingers:
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Agricultural productivity in Sub-Saharan Africa lags behind all
  other regions of the world. Decades of investment in agricultural research and extension have yielded more
  evidence on what fails than on what works---especially for the small-scale producers
  who dominate the sector.
  We study a program that targets multiple constraints to productivity at   once,
  similar to anti-poverty "graduation" interventions. Analyzing a randomized   controlled trial in western
  Kenya, we find that participation causes statistically and economically
  significant gains in output, yields, and profits. In our preferred
  specification, the program increases maize production by 26% and profits by
  16%. The program increases yields uniformly across the sample,
  while treatment effects on total output and profit impacts are slightly
  attenuated at the top end of the distribution.

* [Filling a Niche: the Maize Productivity Impacts of
Adaptive Breeding by a Local Seed Company in Kenya](files/BCLMNT_2020.pdf)
_with Samuel Bird, Michael Carter, Travis Lybbert, Mary Mathenge and Tim Njagi_ <br>
Submitted :crossed_fingers:

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper explores the idea that competitive seed systems may underserve
  farmers in small agro-ecological niches, leaving those farmers less productive and poorer than they need be.
  We develop a theoretical model of the confluence of demand and supply factors that can result in such an equilibrium.
  We then empirically study the disruption of the maize seed market in Western Kenya that took place when public sector foundation breeding and social impact investment capital together allowed a local seed company to expand and target the area with adaptively-bred maize varieties.
  A three-year RCT reveals that these seed varieties increased farmer yields and revenues, both for better-resourced farmers (who used non-adapted hybrids
  and fertilizer prior to the intervention) as well less well-resourced farmers (who did not).
  This theoretical and empirical evidence suggests news ways for thinking about seeds systems in areas typified by high levels of agro-ecological heterogeneity.

* [Media and Motivation: the Effect of
Performance Pay on Writers and Content](files/BGT2020.pdf)
_with Ivan Balbuzanov and Jared Gars_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We study how incentives for journalists affect the quantity, quality, and composition of online
  media content. We report results from a field experiment within an online news firm in Kenya.
  Writers were randomly allocated to earn a piece-rate per article published or to a pay-per-view
  (PPV) contract. The PPV contract induced writers to produce more "popular" articles, but
  writers chose to submit fewer articles. Specifically, the PPV contract resulted in a 120% increase
  in total pageviews, a 180% increase in pageviews per article, and a 40% reduction in the number
  of articles produced. In line with our theoretical predictions, the effect on article quantity
  is concentrated among risk averse writers. Further, when given a choice, risk-averse writers
  tend to select out of the output-based contract. We also document changes along multiple
  non-incentivized dimensions of news production: writers shift away from producing local news
  towards national-level news. We see limited changes in article quality or in the prevalence of
  clickbait. Our study suggests that output-based incentive contracts have substantial implications
  for journalists' effort and content choices, and more broadly for selection into risky "gig work."

* [A Group Random Coefficient Approach to Modeling Heterogeneity in Technology Adoption](files/TGBLMM2020)
_with Oscar Barriga Cabanillas, Dalia
Ghanem, Travis Lybbert, Jeffrey D. Michler, and Aleksander Michuda_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Our paper revisits the econometric model that Suri (2011) (S2011) used in her study of heterogeneous returns to agricultural technology adoption. We propose an alternative group random coefficient (GRC) estimation strategy and revisit the empirical puzzle of why relatively
  few sub-Saharan farmers adopt modern technologies. Drawing on recent developments in the
  nonparametric panel identification literature, we start with an unrestricted GRC model that
  nonparametrically identifies the returns to adoption under time homogeneity. We show that the
  parameters of the S2011 correlated random coefficient model (CRC) can be identified from a
  restricted version of the GRC method. Specifically, the model in S2011 implies a key restriction
  that we call linearity in comparative advantage (LCA). Our unrestricted GRC model can be
  used to detect identification concerns for key structural parameters from the CRC model. We
  illustrate our method using the same data set as the original study andnd that the motivating
  empirical puzzle remains unsolved.
